I had the chance to attend OHBM 2016 conference. It was impressive to participate to such a big event and see the huge variety of research topics around neuroimaging. There was an educational course on the [fundamental principles for clinical applications of real-time fMRI](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2016/ED/Real-time%20fMRI%20Fundamental%20Principles%20for%20Clinical%20Applications.pdf). Though real-time fMRI is an emerging and pretty small field of research, it is growing fast and seems to raise a lot of enthusiasm among researchers. I think my favorite keynotes was Tim Behren's on "Storing, using and updating knowledge for behavioural control".  It is amazing to see how with fMRI and clever experimental design you can actually tackle fundamental questions about the neuronal codes and mechanisms. I also really enjoyed David Poeppel's keynote on how the neurobiology of language has evolved over the last twenty years. I presented the preliminary results of my first EEG-fMRI-NF study during the poster session. Here is my [poster]({{ site.url }}/lorraineperronnet/public/download/OHBM_poster_4133_lp.pdf).
