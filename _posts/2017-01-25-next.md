The 2nd french conference on neurofeedback took place on january 25 2017 at ESPCI, Paris. As explained in my [post about the 1st edition of this conference](https://lowpe.github.io/lorraineperronnet/2016/01/19/first_french_NF_day/), the revival of french neurofeedack research is still quite young. The NeXT section of the AFPBN is doing a great job at structuring the field. On the middle term, Their goal is to define, make a list of, to offer a training. This event was free and open to everyone so part of the audience was made of non scientists, but also of Neuroptimal practitioners. While the conference was really of scientific, research and technical matters, and all of the speakers agree. The questions from the audience were often very asked questions about neurofeedback applications: if doctors could prescribe neurofeedback, for what conditions neurofeedback could be used, ... Though I knew it from my readings, it was interesting to see by my own eyes that the social context of neurofeedback is indeed complex, and that there is a big discrepancy between neurofeedback practice and research.
Just after Tomas Ros's great intervention, I gave a talk about unimodal and bimodal EEG/fMRI neurofeedback. My feeling was that though the question of the modality raised interests in a few researchers, it is not a primary concerns for the time being. 
Here are my slides:
