The 2nd french conference on neurofeedback took place on january 25, 2017 at ESPCI, Paris. Just after Tomas Ros's great intervention, I gave a talk about unimodal and bimodal EEG/fMRI neurofeedback. The program can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/lorraineperronnet/public/download/final-programme-en.pdf). My slides can be found.
