On the 9th of march, 2013 I participated to "Ma thèse en 180 secondes". This contest is inspired by the "3 minutes thesis" concept coming from Australia and consists in presenting your PhD topic in 3 minutes in a clear and precise way to a lay audience. It has become pretty popular among french PhD students. We were 12 participants in Rennes, and 38 in the region Bretagne-Loire. It was a great but tough experience as it required to take a step back from our every day research and put ourselves in the place of someone with knowledge of their own. During the training it was interesting to see how people don't necessarily retain from your speech what your want them to. The time of preparation for those 3 minutes of speech was way way over 3 minutes ! For my presentation, I refered to the character Hannibal Lecter and to the movie scene in which he cuts a piece of brain of his victim and feeds it to him. I chose this scene because precisely, this is not what neurofeedback is and because Hannibal might be a good pick for a neurofeedback therapy. At the end of my speech, I invite him to a neurofeedback experience.
