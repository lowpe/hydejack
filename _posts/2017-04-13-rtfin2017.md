\*Warning, post of the future.\* I have waited a long time for the third edition of the real-time fMRI conference to be announced. The second edition took place in february 2015 in Texas and I was so disappointed not to be able to attend it. At that time, we were waiting for the MR-compatible EEG device and so I did not have any work to present yet.  [Rtfin2017](http://rtfin2017.atr.jp/?page_id=36) will eventually take place this year from the 29th of november to the 1st of december in Nara, Japan (good thing that I started learning japanese a few months ago). fMRI-neurofeedback is a very specific research field and this is the main conference specializing in it. Moreover this conference is open to other modalities such as EEG, NIRS and MEG, so it is a good place for the different neurofeedback communities to gather. I'm looking forward to be there !
