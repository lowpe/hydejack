title: Real-time functional imaging and Neurofeedback conference 2017
tags: [events]

Post of the future. I have waited a long time for the third edition of the real-time fMRI conference to be announced. The second edition took place in february 2015 in Texas. At that time, I was just starting my PhD and was so disappointed not to be able to attend it. [Rtfin2017](http://rtfin2017.atr.jp/?page_id=36) will eventually take place this year from the 29th of november to the 1st of december in Nara, Japan (good thing that I started learning japanese a few months ago). fMRI-neurofeedback is a very specific research field and this is the main conference specializing in it. Moreover this conference is open to other modalities such as EEG, NIRS and MEG, so it is a good place for the different neurofeedback communities to gather. I'm looking forward to be there !
