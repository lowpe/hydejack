I have waited a very long time for the third edition of this real-time fMRI conference to happen. The second edition took place in february 2015 in Texas. At that time, I was just starting my PhD and was so disappointed not to attend it. [Rtfin2017](http://rtfin2017.atr.jp/?page_id=36) will eventually take place this year in Nara, Japan (good thing that I started learning japanese a few months ago) :). fMRI-NF is a very specific subject, not many conferences. I can't wait to be there !
