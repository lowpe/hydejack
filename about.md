Hi, this is Lorraine ! 

I am currently finishing up my PhD on the **combination of EEG and fMRI for neurofeedback** at _Inria Rennes_. 

During the first year of my PhD I have conducted a thorough state-of-the-art of EEG-NF/BCI, fMRI-NF/BCI and of EEG-fMRI data analysis. See book chapter.

In the second year, I conducted my first EEG-fMRI-NF study on healthy subjects. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of unimodal EEG-NF and fMRI-NF versus bimodal EEG-fMRI-NF. See Frontiers paper.

In the third year, I conducted my second EEG-fMRI-NF study which goal was to see if subjects would regulate EEG and fMRI differently depending on whether the feedback allowed them to discriminate both signals or not (uni-dimensional versus bi-dimensional feedback). Upcoming paper.

I will be defending my PhD by mid 2017 and will be looking for a post-doctoral position starting early 2018 (I am going home for a few months).
