After engineering school, I worked for 2 years as an IT engineer. I was a bit bored, and found myself reading a lot about neuroscience. I have always been very interested in psychology, medicine, all about the body and the mind. I got back to study. An internship in a experimental neurosciences lab. Then my PhD.
