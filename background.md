I left my homeland [New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia) in 2007 to study in France. After 3 years studying **computer science and applied mathematics** at [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) engineering school in Toulouse, I worked for 2 years as an IT engineer in Paris on rather non-scientific applications (post and banking services). Though I like software development, I was missing the scientific environment. During that time I found myself reading and searching a lot about neurosciences and realized this was actually the field I wanted to be in. I have always been very interested in sciences, especially psychology and medicine, but it took me a while to identify that it was neurosciences which were made for me. So I got back to study in 2013. I had the chance to be accepted in the ["Math√©matiques, Vision, Apprentissage" (MVA)](http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/academics/mva-master-degree-227777.kjsp?RH=ACCUEIL_GB) research master program of ENS Cachan. I took classes on medical imaging, machine learning, computer vision, image processing and object recognition. This was a great way for me to extend my skills to applications in biology and especially neurosciences. The same year I did a research internship in the [Neural Processing, Neuromodulation and sensory plasticity](https://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/teams/Research%20group%20of%20Daniel%20Shulz) team of Daniel Shulz at UNIC, an experimental neurosciences lab. It was a great experience but I realized I wanted to pursue in a more applied context. That is when I started my PhD and met EEG, fMRI and neurofeedback. I will soon upload my resume on this page. In the meanwhile, below is an [interactive timeline of my training and experience](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1N46JXnboI8xHbBq5hj3fjEm70N-6syHMXdVC3_r8cwY&font=Default&lang=en&start_at_end=true&initial_zoom=1&height=650) (it might take a little time to load):
