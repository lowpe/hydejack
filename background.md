I left my homeland [New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia) in 2007 to study in France. After 3 years of engineering school at ENSEEIHT Toulouse, I worked for 2 years as an IT engineer in Paris on rather non-scientific applications (post and banking services). During that time I found myself reading and searching a lot about neurosciences and realized this was actually the field I wanted to be in. I had always been very interested in science, especially psychology and medicine, but it took me a while to identify that it was neurosciences which were made for me. So I got back to study in 2013. During my research master degree, I did an internship in an experimental neurosciences lab. I enjoyed it but realized I wanted to puruse in a more applied context. That is when I started my PhD and met EEG, fMRI and neurofeedback.
